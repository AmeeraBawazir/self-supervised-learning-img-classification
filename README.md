A self supervised model for image classification using rotation as proxy task 
This project is inspired by [Lars Vagnes implemntation of SSL for Image Classification on Cifar-10 dataset](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/self-supervised-learning-for-image-classification-263e320fff07) using the image rotation methedology from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07728.pdf).In our code we implement Cats vs Dogs dataset image classfication task using self supervised learning
